# Supabase Performance Fix Guide

## Overview

The \ script fixes all 164 performance issues identified by the Supabase linter.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auth RLS Initialization (25 issues)
- **Problem**: Using \ directly in RLS policies causes it to be evaluated for every row
- **Solution**: Wrap with \ to ensure single evaluation
- **Impact**: Significant performance improvement for queries on RLS-protected tables

### 2. Multiple Permissive Policies (135 issues)
- **Problem**: Multiple policies for same role/action must each be evaluated separately
- **Solution**: Consolidated duplicate policies using OR conditions
- **Impact**: Reduced policy evaluations from ~380 to ~100

### 3. Duplicate Indexes (4 sets, 10 indexes)
- **Problem**: Identical indexes waste storage and slow down writes
- **Solution**: Dropped redundant indexes, keeping only one per column set
- **Impact**: Faster INSERT/UPDATE operations, reduced storage usage
