Approved by TA: Shawn Fong

Creative Portion:
    I implemented a secure authentication system using clerk. THe system allows users to register via a traditional login interface, using Clerk's secure data protection. Additionally, it offers the convenience of signing up with Google or Github accounts, integrating seamlessly with their OAuth services.<br>
    I implemented an intuitive account management system using Clerk. It is displayed on the top left of the website and interactable. The system showcases the profile picture associated with your account, with the flexibility for suers to update their image manually. Additionally, each user's first and last name are consistently displayed, ensuring a personalized experience tailored to each individual.<br>
    Implemented a quick and easy css design using TopLoader that shows loading screens for the page with a spinning wheel in the beginning and a loading function at the top of the screen.<br>
    I implemented a quick and easy sorting so that the ToDo list is sorted from the quickest assignment due instead of whichever is created first or last.<br>
    I have implemented a tagging system for each task in the ToDo list app. Users can categorize their activities with specific tags such as "important", "completed", or "Do It Now" (for pending tasks). This feature allows for organization in task management and prioritization, enabling users to efficiently do their task and focus on tasks that require immediate attention.
